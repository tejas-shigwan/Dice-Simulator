# Dice-Simulator
The Dice Simulator is a graphical application built using Python's Tkinter library that mimics the functionality of a real-life dice roll. The main purpose of this project is to generate random dice values when the user clicks a button, providing an interactive and engaging way to simulate dice rolls. The Dice Simulator is a simple desktop application developed using Python and the Tkinter library. This application simulates the rolling of a standard six-sided dice. The project offers a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can click a button to "roll" the dice, and the result is displayed on the screen with an image representing one of the six possible outcomes.

Features:
Interactive GUI: Users can roll the dice by pressing the "click me to roll" button.
Random Outcome: The result of each roll is generated randomly using Python's random module.
Dynamic Dice Images: Each possible outcome (1-6) is represented by a corresponding dice image, which changes dynamically after every roll.
